Errors (debug tips for NoSuchMethodError, FormatException, etc.).
Interactive code (instructions for readLineSync).
Successful runs (celebratory messages).


Believing Soldier: Optional encouraging messages to keep you motivated.
Username authentication via VS Code input box.
In development: Idle chatter and customizable chatter files.
